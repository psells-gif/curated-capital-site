## 1. Brand Overview

### Our Mission

Curated Capital is a **private asset platform** that helps sophisticated collectors see, value, and unlock the capital in their luxury assets. We serve discerning clients who understand that their watches, jewelry, and art are investments—not just possessions—and who want the visibility and liquidity options they deserve.

### Brand Positioning

**Curated Capital sits at the intersection of wealth management and luxury collecting:**

| Traditional Option | The Gap | Curated Capital |
|-------------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Pawn shops** | Stigmatized, unfair valuations, transactional | Dignified, fair market valuations, relationship-driven |
| **Banks** | Won't accept luxury assets as collateral | Accept watches, jewelry, art; fast approvals |
| **Auction houses** | Weeks/months to sell, permanent loss | Days to funding, assets returned after repayment |
| **Spreadsheets** | No real-time valuations, manual tracking | Automated portfolio view with market data |

### Core Insight

> People who own valuable watches, jewelry, and art hold a strong conviction that these items are investments. They list them on personal financial statements. They schedule them on insurance policies. They think of them as capital.
>
> But unlike stocks—where you can check the price anytime and borrow against your portfolio with a few clicks—these assets exist in a blind spot. You *believe* your collection is worth $300K, but you don't really *know*.
>
> **Curated Capital changes that.**

### Target Audience

**Primary: The Affluent Collector**
- Net worth: $1M - $10M
- Owns $250K - $500K+ in luxury collectibles
- Views luxury purchases as both enjoyment AND investment
- Lists items on personal financial statements
- Values discretion, speed, expertise, and professional service

**Secondary: The Aspiring Collector**
- Owns $50K - $250K in collectibles
- Building collection intentionally
- Wants to track performance like investments
- May grow into primary persona over time

### Brand Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Visibility** | See what your collection is actually worth—real-time, data-backed valuations |
| **Liquidity** | Access capital without selling; unlock the borrowing power in what you own |
| **Expertise** | Deep understanding of luxury markets, authentication, and valuation |
| **Sophistication** | Private banking experience for discerning collectors; refined at every touchpoint |
