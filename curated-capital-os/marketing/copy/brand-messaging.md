# Curated Capital Portfolio
## Brand & Marketing Language

---

## Core Brand Concept

### The Insight
People who value and own expensive personal assets—watches, jewelry, fine art—generally hold a strong conviction that these items are investments, not just possessions. They list them on personal financial statements. They schedule them on insurance policies. They think of them as capital.

But unlike stocks, where you can check the price anytime and borrow against your portfolio with a few clicks, these assets exist in a blind spot. You *believe* your collection is worth $300K, but you don't really *know*—because there's no ticker, no market price, no portfolio view.

**Curated Capital changes that.**

### The Name
"Curated" works on two levels:
1. **The collection is curated** — assembled with taste, intention, and sophistication
2. **The service is curated** — built for people who think about value this way

"Capital" reframes what these items are: not just things you own, but assets you hold. Wealth in a different form.

Together: **Curated Capital** — for people who understand that capital isn't just what's in your brokerage.

## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Attributes
- **Sophisticated, not stuffy** — We speak to successful people as peers, not clients
- **Confident, not arrogant** — We know what we're doing; we don't need to prove it
- **Clear, not clever** — Smart people appreciate directness
- **Warm, not cold** — Luxury should feel welcoming, not intimidating

### Tone Guidelines
- Use "you" and "your" — it's personal
- Avoid jargon unless it's collector language (reference numbers, provenance, etc.)
- Short sentences. Clear points.
- Don't oversell. Understatement signals confidence.

### Words We Use
- Collection, portfolio, assets
- Value, worth, capital
- Track, see, know, unlock
- Sophisticated, discerning, serious
- Real-time, market, data

### Words We Avoid
- "Pawn" or anything associated with it
- "Luxury" (overused, feels try-hard)
- "Exclusive" (unless we mean it)
- "Synergy," "leverage," corporate speak
- Exclamation points (almost never)

## Audience-Specific Messaging

### For the Affluent Collector ($250K-$500K+ in collectibles)
> You've built a collection worth more than most people's homes. You insure it. You protect it. But can you tell me what it's worth today—not what you paid, not what you hope, but what the market says right now?
>
> Curated Capital gives you the portfolio view you've been missing. See real-time valuations. Track performance over time. And when you need liquidity, unlock it—without selling a thing.

### For the Watch Enthusiast
> You know the ref number of every piece in your collection. You follow the market. You've probably checked Chrono24 more times than you'd admit.
>
> Now imagine all of that—market prices, your purchase history, gain/loss, borrowing capacity—in one dashboard. Updated daily. No spreadsheets required.

### For the Art Collector
> Art is personal. But it's also an asset class—one that's historically been impossible to track like the rest of your portfolio.
>
> Curated Capital brings your collection into view. See valuations based on real auction data and gallery sales. Track what you own. Understand what it's worth.

### For the Jewelry Collector
> That Cartier Love bracelet isn't just beautiful—it holds value. But unlike your stock portfolio, you've never been able to see that value update in real time.
>
> Until now. Curated Capital tracks branded jewelry from Van Cleef, Cartier, Tiffany, and more—so you always know where you stand.

## Elevator Pitches

### 10 seconds
"Curated Capital is a portfolio tracker for luxury collectors—real-time valuations for your watches, jewelry, and art."

### 30 seconds
"If you own valuable watches, jewelry, or art, you probably think of them as investments. But unlike stocks, you have no idea what they're worth on any given day. Curated Capital fixes that. We pull market data to show you real-time valuations, track your performance, and show you how much you could borrow against your collection. It's the portfolio view for what you actually own."

### 60 seconds
"Most affluent collectors have $250K or more in watches, jewelry, and art—and they know these are assets, not just possessions. They list them on financial statements. They insure them. But here's the problem: unlike stocks or real estate, there's no way to see what they're worth today. You're holding conviction without data.

Curated Capital changes that. We aggregate market data from Chrono24, auction houses, and luxury resale platforms to give you a real-time portfolio view of your collection. You see what each piece is worth, how it's performed since you bought it, and—through our lending arm—how much you could borrow against it without selling.

It's the first dashboard built for serious collectors. Because your collection is capital. Now you can see it."
